            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongest all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of almighty God besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon man, frō the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, as there is none more glorious and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, then the geuing of his owne sonne to vs, and for vs, to be crucified: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of all duties that man cā do, or that is of man required to be done to God, there is none so high, nor so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God, as to embrace the same his welbeloued sōne by fayth into our hartes, and onely to seeke his glory. This dutie &amp; seruice to his crucified Christ so farre excelleth in the sight of God the father, &amp; maker of all thinges, that euen according as we seeke after his sonne, so he regardeth vs, as we loue his sonne, so are we loued of him, as we beleue in his sonne, and glorifie his name, so much the father for his sake, glorifieth vs, iustifieth, and accepteth vs, and otherwise not: For other acceptation &amp; fauour of God to mankinde there is none, but that onely which standeth in the fayth and obedient submission of all men to Christ their cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied redemer, and glorious Sauiour. The reason whereof standeth thus.</p>
            <p>First, forasmuch as no fleshe els is found iuste, so is there none els, that cā stand in the iudgement of God, but onely his.</p>
            <p>Againe, forsomuch as he in his perfect righteousnesse wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king here in earth with all his hart, word, &amp; dede in all things, and aboue all thinges, did seeke the glory onely of his father: so his father now likewise in heauen seeketh againe to set vp, and will set vp the glory of his sonne.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, because the same welbeloued sonne of his, being here so innocent, and giltie of no death, was contented notwithstanding so humbly to debase him self, &amp; to be deiected as a seruaunt vnder all men, to obey his fathers will, euen to death, yea &amp; the most ignominious death of the crosse: so hath
<pb facs="tcp:2699:3"/> it pleased his father agayn to exalte hym, not onely to surmoūt the glory of all princes and potestates, what soeuer, but also with such power and maiestie hath aduaunced hym, that euen the very knowledge and belefe of his name geueth euerlasting lyfe to all sinners, be they neuer so greuously burdened or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, who soeuer doe come to him.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, seyng now all the felicitie and comfort of mans lyfe consisteth onely in the knowledge of Christ Iesus and in glorifying of hys name, and in nothyng els: what then can be more needefull to the health and saluation of all men, then to preach Christ Iesus, and the glory of hys kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is to be glorified and must be glorified, and if we will not glorifie hym, God will sturre vp yea stones and wormes of the earth to glorifie his sonne. For his glory must prosper and encrease, and at length will cast downe all the glory of this world, so that in the end no glory shall stand, but onely of Christ Iesus crucified. S. Paul vnderstandyng this glorious maiestie of the sonne of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> regarded to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els but onely Christ Iesus, &amp; him crucified. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our partes shal be, especially which be preachers &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Christes Church, to employ all our endeuour to the same, that Christ Iesus may be preached and glorified, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in these our dayes &amp; tymes: wherin the world semeth to grow in an vtter cōtempt of Christ and of his kingdome. For, to omitte first to speake of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
               <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkes,</hi> which be professed enemyes to the Crosse of Christ, &amp; haue dispoyled him of the greatest portion of his vniuersall Church: euen amongest vs which yet remaine, and beare the name of Christiās, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do lyue as though either we knew not Christ, or beleued not his teachyng, or passed not much what we professe?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ignorāce and contempt of Christ in the world.</note>Of this ignorance and contempt of Christ, riseth all these heapes of mischiefes, which dayly growe and now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the world. The deuill rageth, the <hi>Turke</hi> dayly wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the Papist persecuteth, and yet all this will not awake vs to seke to Christ, in whom onely lyeth all our victorie. Our couetous, voluptuous, vitious, &amp; ambitious life, what decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, but either infidelitie, or contempt of Christes kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? we talke of heauen: we walke not to heauen. What soeuer our outward face pretendeth, to examine our hartes by our fruites, what thyng almost is so vile in this world, which we esteme not more then the kyngdome of heauē? The glory of Christ is not our study, or certes is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> least part of our study.
<pb facs="tcp:2699:3"/> Our wittes and senses are so occupyed in other artes, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, sciences, and studies, or so employed in worldly affaires, that what was done in the mount of <hi>Caluary</hi> for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, scarse we haue laysure to thinke thereof: or if we thinke a litle, it sincketh not downe, it taryeth not with vs. We heare of the glory of Christ, but we feele it not: we talke of Christ, but haue no experience of him, nor acquaintance with him: we honour hym with lippes, but our hart hungereth not after him: outwardly we professe him, but inwardly we passe not for him. For I count Christ then not passed for, when any thing is preferred before him. And this is the cause, why amongest vs Christians vice so reigneth, the phantasies of the worlde so florisheth, life ruled by affections, man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with vanitie, true peace lacketh, blind ignorance and superstition aboundeth, spirituall knowledge and power in mā is so weake, and the deuill so strong by his sorceries and witchcraftes, to hurt and enchaunt vs, as he doth, and mā not able to withstand him. Why? Because Christ dwelleth not in vs, who onely can ouercome the deuill. For without Christ man can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, to awake the hartes of such Christians in these drowsie dayes of carnall securitie, to the contemplation of the glorious kyngdome of Christ, I was the more willyng at the request of certaine frendes to condescend, in bestowyng a litle paynes herein: And partly also for the Papistes cause to doe them some good if I could, who albeit they professe the whole history of Christes passion as we doe, yet by their doctrine it seemeth, they goe no further then the outward history. They make much adoe about the Crosse of Christ, and haue fought these 500. yeares for his Crosse:<note place="margin">The passion of Christ crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not rightly knowen in the Church of Rome.</note> and yet they know not his Crosse, neither doe they see much more in the passion of Christ, then <hi>Animalis homo,</hi> that is, the sensible man may do. They see him poore, sweating, bleeding, falsely accused, wrongfully oppressed, wounded, scourged, derided, crowned with thorne, nayled, crucified, hangyng vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> crosse naked, perced, dead, and buried. All this they see and graunt with vs, his miracles also they confesse which he wrought, &amp; that he rose agayne the thyrd day, &amp; ascended vp &amp;c. And because they graūt the same to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sonne of God, therfore they magnifie &amp; worship all the outward implementes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> went to his blessed passion, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nayles, the crosse &amp; tymber, the speare, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> crowne &amp; thornes, hys coate and tunicle &amp;c. And herein stādeth almost the <hi>summa totalis</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:2699:4"/> their Religion.<note place="margin">The summe of the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion standeth all in outward thinges.</note> But this is not enough. To know Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus crucified, and to know him rightly, it is not sufficient to stay in these outward thynges: we must go further then the sensible man, we must looke inwardly with a spirituall eye into spirituall thynges. Neither is it perfectly enough for vs to know that Christ was crucified, that he rose agayne, and ascended, &amp;c, for the <hi>Turkes</hi> and euill spirites know this: but here is neede of Gods holy spirite, and reuelation, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen further vnto vs wherefore he dyed, wherefore he rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, &amp; for whom, that is, for our sinnes &amp; our iustification: to know, not onely the story of his death, but the power of his death and vertue of his resurrection: to know what his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng here in earth wrought aboue in heauen, and vnderneath in hell:<note place="margin">The right knowledge of Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> how by the bloud of his crosse, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law is satisfied, Gods wrath killed, his fauour reconciled, all thinges pacified both in heauen and in earth, the deuill conquered, death vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, hell gates destroyed: to know that crucified sacrifice of Christes body to be a perfect deliuerance of all his people frō the begynnyng to the end of the world, to be a full satisfaction once and euer for all our sinnes, an absolute discharge and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietance for all our debtes: briefly to be a free iustification, redemption and righteousnes before God for euer, to all them that beleue in him, without any other meanes or helpe annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto. And this is to know aright Christ Iesus crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The knowledge wherof semeth to be wanting now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as may sensibly appeare by their doctrine and institutes, by their auricular confession and satisfaction for sinnes, by their dayly sacrifice, propitiatory Masses, tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and Purgatory, by merites of supererogation, Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saintes, the Popes pardons, &amp; dispensations: Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all the procedyngs of that Church, euen frō the holywa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stocke to the hāgyng pixe on y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> high altar. Which all beyng packt in one fardell, as in <hi>Pandoras</hi> boxe together, make but a heape or chaos of phantasticall trifles, proceeding onely of the ignorance of Christ Iesus crucified, and thereof take their ground and beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Errours of the Popes church how they come and take their beginning.</note>Wherfore, to remoue this disease of ignoraunce partely frō these aboue rehearsed, wherby they may be reduced into the kynges hyeway of their saluation: but especially for you that be mournyng in conscience, to comfort you in Christ Iesus crucified, whom the terrour of the law to much oppresseth: I was so much the rather persuaded to haue this Sermon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
<pb facs="tcp:2699:4"/> that Christ Iesus might not onely be preached to the eares of some, but also printed, yea &amp; paynted, if I might, to the eyes of many. In which Sermō although I haue not, nor could not fully folow in speach &amp; forme euery thing so precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as was spokē: yet so farre as remēbrance could serue me, I haue not much digressed from the sentence, order, &amp; principall poyntes in the sayd Sermon cōteined: Addyng withall some thynges more which I thought before to haue spoken, and either for plentie of matter, or lacke of memorie were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.

            <p>Let me tell you à story, which I remēber was done about y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beginning of Quene <hi>Maries</hi> raigne, an. <hi>1554.</hi> There was à certain message sent, not from heauen, but from <hi>Rome:</hi> not from God, but frō the Pope: not by any Apostle, but by à certain

                  <desc>••</desc>

            <p>Well, and what message was this? Forsooth, that the Realme of England should be reconciled againe vnto their father the Pope: that is to say, that the Queene with all her nobilitie and sage Counsell, with so many learned Prelates, discrete Lawyers, worthy commons, and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> whole body
<pb facs="tcp:2699:7"/> of the Realme of England, should captiue thē sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and become vnderlings to an <hi>Italian</hi> straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and frierly Priest sitting in <hi>Rome,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew England, neuer was here, neuer did or shal do Englād good.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ste.

            <p>Well then, &amp; will we see what à weighty mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage this was that <hi>Gardiner</hi> so exquisitely cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth? First, the sender is gone, the messenger is gone, the Queene is gone, and the message gone, and yet England standeth not à rushe the better. Of which message I thus say, answering againe to <hi>Gardiner, per inuersionē rhetoricam,</hi> that as he sayth, it was the greatest, so I say againe, it was the lightest legacie, the most ridiculous trifle, and most miserablest message, of al other y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> euer came, or euer shall come to England, none excepted, for vs to be recōciled to an outlandish priest, &amp; to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our neckes vnder à forrein yoke. What haue we to do more with him, then with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great <hi>Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> of <hi>Damascus.</hi> If recōciliation ought to folow, where offences haue risen: the Pope hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs more then his cofers are able to make vs amendes. We neuer offended him. But let the Pope with his reconciliation and Legates goe, as they are already gone (God be thāked) and I beseech God so they may be gone, that they neuer come here again. Englād neuer fared better then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2699:7"/> when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pope did most curse it. And yet I heare whispering of certaine priuy reconcilers,<note place="margin">The Popes priuy reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers secretly creeping in corners.</note> sent of late by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pope, which secretly creepe in corners. But this I leaue to thē that haue to do withall. Let vs againe returne to our matter.</p>
            <p>We then hauing this Legation sent to vs, not frō the Pope, but euē from our Lord &amp; God: not by any Cardinall of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by the elect vessell of Christ, the Apostle <hi>S. Paule</hi> and other Apostles: let vs attend with reuerence, first to him that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, then to the messengers y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> be sent vnto vs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring how <hi>Raab</hi> the harlot receaued y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of <hi>Moses</hi> and was preserued:<note place="margin">Iosue. xxvj.</note> remembring also the wordes of our Sauior: <hi>He that heareth you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. x.</note>
               <hi>heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, considering with our selues (good Christian audience) the high maiestie of this our supreme prince the sender of this message, being not onely our head &amp; king annointed, but which also of loue gaue his life and bloud as this day to be spent for our redemption: let vs for our partes, if we be his subiectes, marke what our prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: let the flocke heare what the Pastor tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: the body what y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> head speaketh: the spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, what the spouse sendeth. And thus much touching the sender of the message.</p>
            <p>Now what these messengers be,<note place="margin">The messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> and who they are: the Apostle proceding further in the letter, thus inferreth: <hi>We</hi> (saith he) <hi>be sent as messengers. &amp;c.</hi> speaking not of him self alone, nor of <hi>Peter</hi> alone, nor of any Apostle one more then an other, but iointly ioyning thē all in one office &amp; calling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without difference of degree or singularitie
<pb facs="tcp:2699:8"/> of person, he saith: <hi>We be sent as messengers or Apostles:</hi> For so signifieth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name of <hi>Apostolus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apostolus,</hi> what it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</note> as much to meane as à messenger or à Legate sent. Where is to be noted by the way, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> this nominatiue <hi>[Nos]</hi> in the pluratiue nūber is not here to be expoūded after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> stile of <hi>Rome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stylus Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Curiae.</note> For <hi>Stylus Romanae Curiae,</hi> or rather <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>So y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> directing forth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes or Buls, neuer speaketh in other nūber, but <hi>Mandamus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pope will needes be singular, &amp; yet disdaineth to speake in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note>
               <hi>Statuimus, Ordinamus, &amp; Volumus.</hi> And although he be but one singular person that speaketh, and such as will needes be singular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone aboue all others: yet disdaineth he to speake in the singular nūber, but alwayes vseth the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to expresse belike, his <hi>Regale sacerdotiū.</hi> Who because he feeth great Kinges &amp; Emperours fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent this trope of writing and speaking, least he should seeme in any point inferior to them, or not to speake as bigge as they for their liues, vseth therefore the same regall or imperiall phrase of speach,<note place="margin">Os loquens grandia.</note> with his <hi>Mandamus, &amp; volumus. &amp;c.</hi> when as Christ in the Gospell is content to say: <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nouum do vobis:</hi> not <hi>damus vobis. &amp;c.</hi> But if the Pope will not follow the humilitie of Christ in the Gospell, let him beware he followe not the swelling Tode in <hi>Aesopes</hi> Fables: who seing the great Oxe, and disdaining, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Oxe should be bigger then he, swelled him selfe so bigge, that at length he swelled him self out of his own skinne.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2699:8"/> But let the Popes courtly stile passe, which as it is à thing but puft vp with the winde of pride, so let it vanishe away with the winde also.</p>
            <p>This is certaine, that <hi>S. Paule</hi> in these wordes, <hi>We come as messengers. &amp;c.</hi> meaneth no such matter: to signifie either him selfe alone, or <hi>Peter</hi> alone,<note place="margin">No singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among the Apostles.</note> or any other of the Apostles singularly: but ioyntly cōprehendeth the whole fellowship of the blessed Apostles together, and declareth, that they all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ioyned in one commission, are sent in the behalfe and name of Christ, as Legates or mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, and not onely to these <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom here he writeth, but inclusitiuely to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wheresoeuer either collected or dispersed in the whole world, according as it was enioyned them by the Lordes owne speciall cōmission, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Goe into the whole worlde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. xvj.</note>
               <hi>and preach this Gospell or glad message to euery creature. Whosoeuer beleueth and is baptised, shall be saued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, and what shall we then say? Did this message of the Apostles cease with the end of the Apostles? or did the preaching thereof extend no farther, but during the cōtinuance of their time? Yes verily: for he which then set them on worke, and sent thē in this message,<note place="margin">Posuit in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis sermonem reconciliatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note>
               <hi>putting in their mouth the word of reconcilement,</hi> is the same Lord which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth still, and ceaseth not to send messengers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church frō time to time: <hi>Some Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelistes, some teachers and instructers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. iiij.</note> some with one gift, some with an other,<note place="margin">Christ neuer ceaseth sending messengers to the edifying of his Church.</note> and all for the edifying of his people, to haue the message of his Gospell continued in the world, which still shall be continued, so long as his Church shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure:
<pb facs="tcp:2699:9"/> for he can not, nor will not totally &amp; finally forsake his Church, which is his kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">False messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note>But as it then happened in the Apostles time, there crept in with them certaine <hi>Pseudolegati,</hi> false Apostles, &amp; sinister teachers, which confoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding together the lawe with the Gospell: <hi>Moses</hi> with Christ: mans merites with mercy: confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in workes with Gods free grace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, laboured to peruert the course of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed message sent to vs by the mouth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: so hath there not lacked since that time in the Church, some <hi>Pseudocatholici</hi> and false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, not sent of God to do his message, but cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in craftily to lead à loytring life, some impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, some negligent, some ignoraunt and blinde, <hi>hauing a zeale of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. x.</note>
               <hi>but not after knowledge,</hi> as <hi>S.

            <p>But blessed be the God of all consolation, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Iesus, who hath visited vs frō an high with such mercy and grace, and hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp such ministers and messengers of his holy grace and Gospell to his Church, which so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly accord and tune in one string together, to set forth the liuely message and truth of Christes Gospell vnto you. Which you dayly doe heare.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2699:9"/> Which as it doth me good to see, so doe I most hartily reioyce from the bottome of my hart and soule, and prayse God with my harty thankes therfore. And yet neuerthelesse, to speake the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truth touching the present state of this our ministery, if I should say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> nothing therein were à misse, I should in deede blaunch and flatter to much. For who seeth not that many this day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ministery, not as Gods messengers sent vpon any message frō him, but winding in them selues by hooke or crooke, or by some compound way,<note place="margin">The ministery not cleare from abuses.</note> parting halfe stakes as it were betwene their patrons &amp; them, and hauing either no arte to finde thē, or no minde to labour, make à trade of liuing of the ministery, more to liue at ease, then to labour in Gods message.</p>
            <p>Many other abuses might be here recited, but I am not at this time to complaine of any: but onely to preach Christ Iesus crucified vnto you. And if there be any thing in them further to be complained of, I leaue it either to the ministers thēselues, or to their patrons that receaue them, or to their Bishops which induct them, to looke vpon it. But to our purpose: they that will be the true messengers of God, let them well consider what their office is, whose messengers they are, and do their message faythfully.</p>
            <p>The office of ministers was wont in the time of barbarous Popery, to be counted <hi>Orare,</hi>

After y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you haue heard againe of the singular and superabundant greatnesse of his fatherly tendernesse toward vs, who so willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so kindly, not onely offreth his reconciliation, but also inuiteth vs, yea prayeth vs to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to hym.</p>
            <p>Now, what thys reconciliation is, and what great thinges come thereof, it followeth likewise to be considered. Which albeit can not so amply be described to you as it is in it selfe, yet by simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and examples partly it may be conceaued. For as we see in à worldly gouernment,<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> when any subiect is vnder the indignation and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his prince, his state is miserable, his minde
<pb facs="tcp:2699:16"/> vnquiet, fraught full of feare, and dread, hys hart out of comfort, in hys life no safety, but he liuing like à dead man: briefly no calamitie lacketh, where the wrath of à Prince hangeth. But if the trespasse be pardoned, and displeasure remoued, then feare departeth, hope reuiueth, comfort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and life beginneth to looke vp. Euen so, or rather much more then so, it is betwene God and man. For so long as we were vnder wrath, there was nothing in man but death, dread, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hell, malediction, the tyranny of Sathan, vnquietnesse: in summe, all the miseries of hell were heaped vpon the poore soule of man.

            <p>But what should I set forth the high ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thys heauenly reconciliation of our Lord by earthly similitudes, which by no comparison of man can be expressed? For in mans agreement, though the prince be recōciled neuer so well with the subiect, yet it may happen that the agreement may breake off againe shortly after. Againe, the reconcilement that is betwene man and man, is commonly but for that one trespasse which bred the variance: which being forgeuen, agreement cōmeth. So is it not betwene God and vs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2699:16"/> is hys reconciliation so variable or incōstant as altereth by dayes or times:<note place="margin">Reconciliation of God, what it is.</note> but is the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of mankinde into the aeternall fauour and mercy of God, euen the same fauour which <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet, Chapt. <hi>54.</hi> speaketh of in these wordes, saying:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay.</hi> 54.</note>
               <hi>For a little moment of time I haue left thee, but in great mercies I will gather thee. In a moment of my indignation, I haue hid my face a while from thee: but in my euerlasting mercy, I haue pitied thee, sayth the redemer thy Lord. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reconciliation now to be defined,<note place="margin">Reconciliation defined.</note> is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing againe of mā into the perpetuall fauour of God, purchased by Christ to all them, that by fayth and repentance come vnto hym.

For as that malediction did threaten vnto vs aeternall reiection, vnder which we were and should perpetually haue cōtinued had it not bene stopped: so is thys reconcilement à receauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into aeternall acceptation, which perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually doth and shall continue for Christes sake, to all faythfull beleuers in hym. And this fauour I call perpetuall in respect of time: for that God promiseth neuer to remember, nor to impute our

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.</note> And hereof springeth the foūtaine of perpetuall remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, promised in the xiij. chapter of the Prophet <hi>Zachary:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.</note> where he sayth: <hi>In that day shall be open to the house of Dauid, and to the dwellers of Ierusalem, a foū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the clensing away of sinne, <hi>&amp; menstrui. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where note how the Prophet sayth: <hi>In that day. &amp;c.</hi> assigning not diuers and sundry dayes whē Christes body should be offred for sinne: but signifying that one day should come, when that Lambe and sacrifice which was slaine from the beginning of the world in Gods determination, and afterward was offered actually once and no more, should suffise to purge the sinnes and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all the dwellers in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that is, of all such as retaine to him by faith.<note place="margin">Christes body once offred for sinne, and no more.</note> And thus haue you the cause of remission of sinnes to be onely the sacrifice of Christes body offred vp to God, not euery day, but in one appointed day, which we call good friday: for the which sacrifice sake God hath assured his promise to all &amp; singular persons that shall come or seeke to hys sonne by fayth, to geue them free forgeuenesse, and neuer to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor impute their sinnes to them any more.</p>
            <p>And herein standeth the difference betwene the Popes doctrine and ours. For he holdeth that the sacrifice of Christes body not one day, but euery day is to be offred for sinne. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Difference betwene the Popes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and the Scripture.</note> we with the Scriptures affirme, remission of sinnes to be the effect onely of one cause, that is, of Christes bloud our Sauiour, sacrificed once on good friday vpon the Crosse (and neuer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2699:17"/> els) to take away all malediction of sinne for euer, as well for them that were before his passion, as them that should follow after.

               <hi>The Lambe to be slaine from the beginning of the world</hi> (and so is he slaine to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end): meaning therby the vertue and power of that sacrifice to extend vniuersally to all times, to all men, and to all kinde of sinnes, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of the world for euer: So that on Christes part,<note place="margin">The cause of remission of sinnes on Christes part.</note> the cause onely which worketh reconciliation and remission of sinnes, is hys one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death and bloudshedding once sacrificed actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (and neuer els) vpon good friday.<note place="margin">The cause of remission of sinnes on mans part.</note> On our partes the cause onely y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> worketh thys reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remission, and is of vs required, is not to offer vp thys body againe for à dayly sacrifice to God: but onely to beleue faythfully &amp; obediently vpon him that was sacrificed for vs, &amp; so by fayth to apply the merites of hys passion to vs. And to thys fayth God hath promised perpetuall remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our sinnes, according to the manifest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scripture, where it is in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Actes of the Apostles thus expressed:<note place="margin">

            <p>Touching which remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">Remission of sinnes.</note> here is further to be noted: First that thys remission is not onely of such sinnes as goe before Baptisme or regeneration, but also of all such which à man repenteth hym of with fayth, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till the end of hys life. Secondly is to be vnderstand, that thys remission is not onely for all actuall sinnes which man committeth, but also for originall sinne which nature bringeth. Thirdly, neither must we thinke thys remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the new Testament to be like to the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes practised in the olde law, which stoode by sacrifices. Wherin this difference there is: First that remission which was by sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, serued not for all sinnes, nor for such as were to come, but onely for such sinnes as were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2699:19"/> before the sacrifice: so that whensoeuer any new sinne followed, new sacrifices were required.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament and in the olde.</note> Secondly, that remission stoode onely for actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sinne, and not for originall. Thirdly, in that Legall or temporall remission is moreouer to be noted, that sacrifice for sinne was then but à thyng typicall, so that albeit the crime for which the sacrifice was offered was done away, yet the person notwithstanding remained still vnder death and the penalty of originall sinne pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced agaynst <hi>Adam</hi> and all hys posterity. Briefly in one word to conclude, betwene this remission of the new Testament and that of the olde, so much difference there is, as is betwene temporall thinges and aeternall. Of which difference let vs heare what the Prophet <hi>Iereme</hi> teacheth vs, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Behold the dayes shall come, saith the Lord, &amp; I shall make a new couenaunt with the house of Israell, and the house of Iuda, not after the couenaunt which I made with their fathers whē I brought them out of Egypt with strong hand, and they transgressed my couenaunt, but this shall be the couenant that I will make with the house of Israell Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those dayes, sayth the Lorde, I will geue my law within them, and in their hart I will write it, and I will be their God, and they my people &amp;c. For I will haue mercy of their iniquities, and their sinnes I will neuer more remēber. &amp;c. <hi>Ieremy. 31.</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iere.</hi> 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By these wordes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Prophet, if they be well marked, we haue to learne à manifest difference betwene the olde couenaunt, and the new: and what the grace is of the new Testament, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cōcerning remission of sinnes: which sinnes
<pb facs="tcp:2699:20"/> he saith shall neuer more be remembred, meaning that the day should come when God will set such à sacrifice for sinne, which shall geue à perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remedy for euer: so y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> although sinne shall nede dayly to be helped, yet no more sacrifices shoulde neede to be offered, but that one should serue and suffice for euer. Wherby we see remission of sinnes to stand otherwise now then it did then. For in the olde law although sinnes were purged after à sort, by sacrifices and bloud of beastes: yet that remission lasted not for euer, but for certaine tymes, so that new sinnes euer required new sacrifices.</p>
            <p>Wherin apperaeth the pernitious abuse of the daily sacrifice of the Popes Masse,<note place="margin">The sacrifice of the Popishe Masse consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> most false and contrary to all Scripture, vtterly subuerting the truth of Gods couenaunt and Testament. For if sinne shoulde neede dayly purgation by dayly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, as it did before, what difference then make we betwene the new Testament and the olde, betwene the Christians and the <hi>Iewes?</hi> Or if Christes body once sacrificed for sinne can not serue except it bee dayly sacrificed for purgation therof, where is then this euerlasting reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taught by the Apostles? or where is thys ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remēbring of our sinnes any more, promised by the Prophets? how is that wounde cured for euer, which euery day needeth à new plaster? Briefly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> how hath he made thē perfect with one oblatiō for euer which be sanctified, if Christ once offered suffice not, but euery day must be offered à fresh? what perfectiō is in that which euery day
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2699:20"/> is new to begin? If sinne (malediction of sinne I meane) be not once taken away for euer, how thē hath Christ made vs perfect for euer? <hi>Heb. 10.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> or how hath he found out aeternall redemption by once offering him selfe for vs? <hi>Heb. 9.</hi> For what is aeternall redemption els, but aeternall remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes? Now, where remission of sinnes is, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same remission aeternall, what nedeth any more hostes or oblations for sinne? as the Apostle plainly testifieth, saying: <hi>Vbi peccatorū est remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio, iam non est amplius oblatio pro peccato. i. <hi>Where remission of sinnes is, there is no more oblatiō for sinne. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs reason now then with these sacrificing Priestes of the Popes law, after their owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions. A cōtinuall or dayly sacrifice, say they, must euer remaine in the Church. For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I aske? For remission of sinnes, say they. So had the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the olde law continuall and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifices for remission of sinne remayning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them also. What difference is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the new Testament &amp; the olde, if the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of sinne remaine in both Testamentes alike, to be done away by continuall reiteration of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices? Or if there must nedes be à differēce,<note place="margin">The cause of doing away sinne discussed.</note> let them shew what difference it is, or wherin it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth els but onely in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cause of remission: which in the new Testament standeth one for euer, in the old Testamēt it is dayly repeated by renuing of sacrifices. Of the which cause the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> speaking of Christ Iesus crucified, and consummated, specifieth moreouer, &amp; sayth: <hi>factus omnibus obtēperātibus sibi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>causa aeternae salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.
<pb facs="tcp:2699:21"/> &amp;c. i. <hi>Was made to all which obey him, the cause of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation. &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 5.</hi> By the which wordes we are taught the cause of remission of sinnes to be the onely body of Christ offered for vs, &amp; the same body to be once offered and neuer more, as in the same Epistle followeth in these wordes declared: <hi>Nunc autem semel in instante consummatione. &amp;c. i. <hi>Now hath he once appeared in this latter consummatiō of the worlde, to the destruction of sinne by his owne oblation. &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 9.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> Wherby we haue to note, that as the once appearing of Christ is the onely cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of sinne, and remission not to be sought at any other cause but that alone: so is their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine vayne which require any more appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes of Christ to remitte sinne, then onely the same. And thus appeareth the true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene remission in the olde law, and in the new: wherof the one which stoode by renuing of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices was temporall, the other is perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, perfect I meane as touching the cause of putting away sinne, which once done standeth for euer.</p>
            <p>But here come they with à blinde distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of [bloudy and vnbloudy] and say, that in the <hi>Iewes</hi> law they offered y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bloud of Goates and Calues,<note place="margin">Distinction of the Papistes.</note> and of other diuers sortes of beastes: but in the new lawe they offer continually one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and no moe, which is the body of Christ, and that after an vnbloudy sort. Whereunto I aunswere: first if they haue the body of Christ, let them offer it. But they which doe well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Scriptures, do see &amp; know that Christes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2699:21"/> body is not here to be offered:<note place="margin">How the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes do sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Christes body euery day with bloud.</note> Vnlesse they meane the members of hys mysticall body here in earth, which they sacrifice euery day with such store of bloud, as is pitifull to see: but els the true body of Christ in deede y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Scripture placeth to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and not in earth. Once it was in the handes of sinners and was offered of them, but now he is out of their handes, and past all mens reach to be offered any more. Wherefore, where they say, they offer the body of Christ, that is but à phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. For as the presence of the body here ceaseth, so ceaseth the offering therof also.</p>
            <p>Now, although his bodily presence were here: yet is he not to be offered to appease Gods wrath for sinne any more. For first, none can offer the body of Christ for sinne to hys father, but him self: because in the new Testament to offer for sinne, requireth à Priest which is immaculate, impol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and segregated from sinners, as we read. <hi>Heb. 7.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</note>
               <hi>Talis enim decebat vt nobis esset pontifex, sanctus, innocens. &amp;c i. <hi>For so it behoued, that our Bishop for vs should be holy, innocent. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> And againe: <hi>Sermo autem iurisiurandi, qui post legem esset. &amp;c.</hi> that is: <hi>But the word of the othe which followeth after the old law, appointed his sonne to be our perfecte Priest for euer. &amp;c. <hi>Heb. 7.</hi>
               </hi> Secondly, by the types of the olde lawe Christ can not be offered for sinne but it must be without the tentes by the law, or els hys sacrifice cā not answere to the law. Thirdly, when soeuer Christ is offered for the pacifying of Gods wrath for sinne, it must be vppon the crosse. For so we read. <hi>Coloss. 1.</hi>

            <p>Briefly, to bring in any other sacrifices for sin, but onely the oblation of Christes bloud, and that once offered, taketh away the glad message and power of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Daily sacrifice in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament for sinne, dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> casteth mens mindes into à doubtfull wauering of their saluation, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally dissolueth the whole harmony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both Propheticall &amp; Apostolicall.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2699:23"/> still went forward: euen so the elect mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christes Church after their deliueraunce, when they sinne against God by fragility of weake flesh, their sinnes be punished with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall scourges in this world, but yet the truth of Gods euerlasting fauour standeth for euer to all them that repent by fayth.</p>
            <p>As touching therefore the dayly sacrificing of Christes body, as I proued before, so I repeate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine &amp; in one word conclude, that no sacrifice of Christes body can serue for sinne, but where Christ him selfe is the Priest.<note place="margin">The scripture admitteth no sacrifice for sinne, but where Christ is the offerer, where bloud is, and where the hoaste is consumed without the tentes.</note> Neither doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture admitte any sacrifice propitiatory for sinne, but were bloud is, and where the suffering goeth withall, and where the hoast is consumed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tentes by the fier of Gods iudgement.</p>
            <p>These thinges thus discoursed and proued by the Scriptures, to procede now in our text, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almighty God so gently offereth vnto vs, (as ye haue heard good audience) let vs take that he geueth: seing he calleth so graciously, let vs come to him: yea seing he prayeth so entirely, let vs graunt his request: and seing so fatherly he sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to vs the armes of his reconciliation, let vs with the lost sonne returne home agayne to our father: briefly seing on his part there is nothing lacking that we can desire, let vs now for our partes do that he desireth of vs. What is that? <hi>Vt reconciliemini Deo, <hi>that ye will for your partes be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> How should we be reconciled vnto God? Come to Christ, submit your selues, and beleue in him with a true fayth, and thus
<pb facs="tcp:2699:24"/> you are reconciled to the father. For so we read: <hi>If any man serue me, him will my father honour. <hi>Ioh. 12.</hi>

Truth is, the fauour of God is perpetuall to them, whom he receaueth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: and yet albeit this fauour be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, we must not thinke therefore, that God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth now to be angry with sinne, &amp; that we may liue now as we list. <hi>For these thinges,</hi> sayth <hi>S.

            <p>Here therefore we must make à distinction of sinners.<note place="margin">Aunswere by a distinction.</note> Of whom some be repentant and vpry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sinners, some be vnrepentant.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</note> The repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant sinner I call him, who when he slideth, doth it with à repugnance of will going before, &amp; with à repentaunce of hart folowing after. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinner, as he maketh no resistance before sinne, so is he touched w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no remorse after folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but taketh a delyte in that whereof he should lament. The penitent sinner sayth, I haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but by Gods grace I will amende, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no more: the other sayth, I haue sinned, I do sinne, and I will sinne, who soeuer sayth nay. The voyce of the one is: <hi>That good that I would do,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note>
               <hi>that I do not:</hi> the voyce of the other is: the euill that I would do, that do I performe. In the flesh of the one sinne dwelleth, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> calleth <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum inhabitans:</hi> but in the hart of the other sinne raigneth, and beareth the whole rule.</p>
            <p>The difference of these two sinners considered, I aunswere now to the doubt, making thys di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction also of reconciliation, that as there be ij. sortes of iustification: one before God, an other before man: so be there two sortes of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the one is effectuall with God, which <hi>S. Paul</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2699:25"/> calleth <hi>secundum propositum:</hi> the other is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent onely before man. Now then as touching the repentant sinner, I say, that sinne in him absolutely breaketh not reconciliation betwene God and man. For els where were remission of sinnes left to the Church for a remedy to keepe thys attonement perpetuall, if sinne did breake reconciliation? He that by vehemence of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and infirmity of flesh is fallen, or rather cast downe willing to do better, but not able to do what he would, the infirmity of this Christen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent obtaineth remission, breaketh not reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, neither loseth grace, but rather doth illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate grace, as Christ him selfe resoluing thys question, aunswereth to <hi>S. Paul: <hi>My grace,</hi>
               </hi> sayth he, <hi>is enough for thee, for in thy infirmity my power is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. &amp;c. <hi>2. Cor. 12.</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> And againe, the Apostle sayth: <hi>Where sinne aboūdeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>there superaboūdeth grace. <hi>Rom. 5.</hi>
               </hi> meaning that sinne, which is ioyned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce. But contrariwise, they which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously and ostinatly without remorse or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of him whō they offend, take à pleasure and make à custome of sinne, and haue not (to vse <hi>S. Paules</hi> wordes) sinne dwelling in them, but they rather dwell in sinne, and not onely do not resist the temptations of Sathan, but rather are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; Sathans to other to follow their sinfull appetite: to such wilfull men, whom I account no men, but rather monsters of men, I say not that they in thus doing do lose the reconcilement of God, which they had: but that they neuer had this effectuall reconcilement with God, to lose,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2699:25"/> nor neuer shall, vnlesse they through earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, seeke to the sonne of God by fayth for remission of their sinnes, and be truely reconciled vnto God by faythfull obedience.</p>
            <p>By this ye see that such as be sinners,<note place="margin">Sinne abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely doth not breake recōciliation.</note> not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but penitent sinners, though by infirmity they sinne, yet do they not lose the gift of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And why? For although they fall, yet they fall not vnder the law, but vnder grace, that is to say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> though the office of the law is naturally to work wrath: yet forsomuch as the person of the sinner is not vnder the lawe, therefore is he not vnder wrath, but in stead of wrath standeth reconsiliati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, in stead of the law raigneth grace.</p>
            <p>Seing therefore such a loue day (louing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) is made betwen God and you through the mediation of Christes Crosse,<note place="margin">Reconcilie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Deo.</note> be ye now reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto God, as he is to you.

When ye were offenders to God,<note place="margin">Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwene man and man necessary.</note> what he hath done &amp; doth, ye se. So if your neighbours, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, or inferours haue offended you, or you thē: stand not so much in your reputation to disdayne to abase your selues, but either come, or send forth your messengers of peace, not onely to byd him good morow or good euen, but thus say: Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I haue offended you &amp; you me.

            <p>And thus as ye see God hath geuen hys owne sonne to death to reconcile you vnto him: let it not be greuous to you, to geue and forgeue small matters to your neighbour, to nourish amity and agreement betwene him and you, without which agreement I see not how mans lyfe can consist First for so much as in this fragility of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it can not be auoyded but where society is, offenses will either be geuen or taken: some cause of grudge and variaunce will rise betwene man and man, man and wife, frend and frend, yea bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brother, that shall set them à sunder.</p>

For as the lawe hath hys time, so hath grace his time also: and as death hath his time to raigne here: so hath life his time to raigne likewise: and as wrath hath hys working yet à while: so reconciliation shall haue his time to worke hereafter: so that in this world remaineth troubles,<note place="margin">Distinction ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be considered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world, and the world to come.</note> vexations, toyle, labour, misery, calamity, afflictions inward, afflictions outward, the body subiect to sicknesse, the soule to temptations, the flesh to death, the law yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his force, the same penalty of sinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against <hi>Adam,</hi> still taketh hold vpon vs. Briefly, the nature of euery thing in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; vnder the same malediction wherein <hi>Adam</hi> left it, still continueth and shall continue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this outward body, so song as our olde <hi>Adam</hi> liueth: looke for none other in this world, so perswading your selues, that as there hath ben none heretofore, so is there none of you all here

Further what this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of God is, how firme it standeth and perpetuall, what went before it, what variaunce there was betwene him and vs, and how thys variance was reconciled, and Gods wrath paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by one oblation once done for euer: moreouer what thinges followe after this reconciliation, with the golden chaine, and principall pointes of our saluation depending vpon the same, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally how farre the time of the law and of wrath lasteth, and when the time of grace beginneth, what difference is betwene these two times, and how à Christian is both vnder wrath and also vnder reconciliation in diuers respectes, of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mā first, and then of the inward man, with other thinges not vnworthy to be mused vppon, partly is set forth in this former part vnto you.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former part of thys good fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes Sermon, ye heard (louing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) according to my weake abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vttered vnto you the ioyfull mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Gods reconciled fauour and grace recouered againe, which we had once lost through our iust desertes, and were vnder wrath in great daūger perpetually to be cast away both bodyes and soules. But so it pleased the gracious goodnesse of our mercifull God, mercifully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs againe to loue, &amp; to become now of à ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Iusticer à tender father toward vs. Not that there is any chaunge or alteration in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Mercy and iustice ioyned together for mans saluatiō.</note> but that mercy and iustice striuing together, mercy gotte the vpperhand: or rather that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and iustice ioyning together for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath brought to passe, that vppon mercifull causes going before, the iust effect of Gods wrath (which the law before did worke) by good iustice must needes geue place, and reconciliation come in: because that iustice alwayes standing vppon iust causes, it must nedes follow, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered &amp; remoued away, the effect also must nedes cease. So long as we were vnder the law and sinne,<note place="margin">Sublata causa tollitur effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> so long we were vnder wrath, that is, vnder Gods iust punishment for sinne. For y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith) worketh wrath. But after that mercy and iustice ioyning both together haue vā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the law, that is, the curse of the law, now then by good order of Iustice followeth reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2699:34"/> and yet no nature in God chaunged,<note place="margin">Gods wrath turned to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and yet no alteration in God.</note> but his marueilous wisedome excellently declared.</p>
            <p>Now what causes these were, and how they wrought, and how mercy &amp; iustice together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in putting away the law and sinne: conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently here remaineth in the second and latter parcell of this my text to be opened (by Christes helpe) vnto you.

               </hi> Many other places there be in holy scripture, which testifie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, holinesse, &amp; innocencie of this immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late person, of whom it is written: <hi>Which of you can rebuke me of sinne?</hi> Against whom also we read, <hi>that the prince of the world came, and found in him nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note> as writeth <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> meaning therby his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be such and perfection of his life so absolute, that no creature could staine or charge him with blot or blemish. So absolutely he performed the law &amp; euery iote therof, both the first table, &amp; the second, in louing God aboue all thinges, and hys neighbor as him self, that neither was there lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him any thing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the law required, nor any thing forbidden in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law, that in him was found: nor yet any els found able to accomplish the same law, besides him self alone. For so it behoued him, which should die for all, to be holy and innocent
<pb facs="tcp:2699:36"/> alone, and none but he, according as we read and sing in the hymne of <hi>Ambrose:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambrosius in hymno.</note>
               <hi>Tu solus sanctus. i. <hi>Thou onely art holy. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> And so he was, and is, and none els holy and innocent in all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world but he.</p>
            <p>And therfore false is the doctrine of these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true catholickes, who disputing of keeping y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law of God, seeme to extoll <hi>integra naturalia</hi> of man so farre as though it were in mans <hi>posse</hi> and <hi>esse,</hi> to satisfie the performance therof. In which number is <hi>Lombardus, Tho. Aquinas, Anselmus, Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, Alexander de Hales.</hi> Albeit these, as they doe not fully agree in all places with them selues: so because they would seeme somwhat to start from the errour of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> they adde moreouer some addition of Gods grace to helpe free will, and so flying frō one errour, fall into an other, teaching that à man in this life, being once iustified, may fulfill Gods law and auoyde all sinne. After these commeth <hi>Ioan. Scotus,</hi> who reasoning vpon these wordes of <hi>S. Austen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. contra Pelagianos.</note> that à mā without grace can not eschew all sinne. &amp;c. seemeth to resolue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion thus:<note place="margin">Ioan. Scotus Lib. 2. dist. 28.</note> that à man by free will without grace can not eschew or ceasse from all sinne, but seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally may eschew this sinne or that sinne, and so euery particular sinne one after an other, &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this similitude of one being in à vessell full of riftes or holes, in which although he can stoppe one hole after an other, yet can not stoppe thē all, for while he stoppeth one (sayth he) an other is open.<note place="margin">Tho. Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Tho. Aquine</hi> likewise reciting y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sentence of the schole men, sayth, that the power of mans will of it selfe is able to do thinges both good and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2699:36"/> bad without grace: howbeit can not make the worke that is good to merite, but by the helpe of grace. &amp;c. So that hereby appeareth the opinion of these catholickes to be, that albeit mans free power without grace suffiseth not to eschew all sinne, nor to make his good workes to be merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: yet being assisted with grace, is able in this life to auoyde all &amp; euery kind of sinne, and to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the righteousnesse of Gods law: In somuch that <hi>Scotus</hi> in an other place thus reasoneth,<note place="margin">Scot. Lib. 4. dist. 17. artic. 3. sub finem.</note> that it is not vncredible but that many such be in the Church, which liue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole yeare without mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne: yea &amp; by God grace many are which much longer time keepe them selues from deadly sinne, and exercise moreouer many workes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, of whose merites riseth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Treasurehouse of the Church. &amp;c. <hi>Scot. lib. 4. dist. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, after these followed other of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeares, as <hi>Eckius, Pighius, Hosius,</hi> and others: vppon whose vntydie reasons and argumentes, certaine of our <hi>Englishe</hi> Papistes also grounding their vaine opinion, doe likewise teach now in these our dayes,<note place="margin">Whether it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for man in this life to keepe the whole lawe?</note> that it lyeth in possibilitie here in thys life for à man after he be iustified, to fulfill the righteousnesse of the law by grace, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide all mortall sinne: that is to meane, that such aboundance of grace and power is geuen of God here in this life to them that be baptised in Christ, and call for Gods grace, that although for venial sinnes they may say in humilitie and in truth:<note place="margin">Ex Concil.

               <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue vs our trespasses. &amp;c.</hi> yet as touching mortall sinnes, they may so liue, calling for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> grace, that

            <p>First, for confirmation of their doctrine they alleage the testimonies of <hi>Austen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. sermo 60. de tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</note> where he sayth: <hi>that God neither could cōmaund thinges that were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because he is iust: nor would condemne man for that he could not auoyde. &amp;c.</hi> and addeth in an other place, saying:<note place="margin">August. de na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura &amp; gratia.</note>

               <note place="margin">Hierom. to. 4. in expositio. Symboli ad Damas.</note>Secondly, out of <hi>Hierome</hi> they alleage thys place, where he saith: <hi>We detest their blasphemy, which say, that God hath commaunded any thing impossible to be done. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, they alleage farther the wordes of our Sauiour:<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, also for example they inferre <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who in scripture <hi>are said to be iust before God, walking in all the commaundementes and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the Lord without blame. &amp;c. <hi>Luke. 1.</hi>

            <p>Whereunto briefly I aunswere, and first as touching <hi>S.

            <p>If we by grace helping vs (say they) be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe fully &amp; perfectly the righteousnesse of the law, then were God vniust in cōmaunding thinges impossible, &amp; vnmercifull in condemning the seruaunt for that which he can not auoyde.</p>
            <p>But that were detestable blasphemy to say:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> say they, it must needes be concluded, that it is not vnpossible for à iustified man, by Gods grace, to performe the perfect fulfilling of the lawe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Aunswere to the obiection.</note>Whereunto I aunswere by the Scriptures, that if God had geuen such à lawe to be fulfilled of man which no man could fulfill, and that all men for not fulfilling the same, should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, then might they with some reason ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect thys blasphemy vnto vs. But now we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and say, that God hath geuē à law to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled of man, and that he commaundeth nothing vnpossible: yea and furthermore with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures confesse, that man hath fulfilled thys lawe actually, really, and thorowly in all pointes: and yet all this being cōfessed, neither is it true which they inferre, that the iustified mā therfore is able, by grace, to fulfill the reall perfection of the law, neither is it true, that he which fulfilleth it not, shall therfore be condemned, neither that in God is any vnrighteousnesse or vnmercifulnesse in all this to be inferred, but he remaineth still most iust and mercifull: yea &amp; to say truth, hys mercy and iustice could not otherwise both stand &amp; appeare
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2699:38"/> together, but onely by thys way aboue confessed. And how is all this proued?</p>
            <p>First, that God hath geuen à lawe to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, we all confesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that Christ from the beginning,<note place="margin">Christ appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fulfill the lawe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lawe was geuen.</note> before the lawe was geuen, was preordinate to be incarnate and to take our nature, no man can deny.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">How the law is not vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to man, and how it is fully aunswered by man.</note> that the same Christ in the same our nature hath vtterly fulfilled and discharged the law, it is manifest. And how then is that to be accounted vnpossible to man, which mā so clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath accomplished?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that in the same nature and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Christ, the sonne of God and the sonne of man, the whole nature of mankinde is included, the Scripture teacheth:<note place="margin">Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam.</note> and therfore is he called the second <hi>Adam.</hi> For as all we were included in the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> which first disobeyed, and by hym condemned: so are we likewise generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> humane nature of this second <hi>Adam</hi> which first obeyed, and by him saued. So that we being now in Christ, that is to say, God beholding our whole nature in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nature of hys owne sonne, hys fulfilling is our fulfilling, and what he doth, that we doe, especially in all such pointes as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to hys humane working: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he denominated in Scripture to be <hi>Iusticia nostra.</hi> For as thys proposition is true:<note place="margin">Christus iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia nostra.</note>
               <hi>Christus pro omnibus mortuus est. i.</hi> Christ dyed for all men: so is this proposition true also:<note place="margin">Christ onely innocent for all men.</note>
               <hi>Christus pro omnibus innocens factus est. i.</hi> Christ was made

So that what he hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we also haue fulfilled, although not after the same maner, yet in as good effect as if it had bene after the same maner done: He for vs, we by hym: he actually performed, we by imputation: he by vertue and merite, we by gift &amp; grace.

            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, and though it be so (as it is in deede) that no such grace is geuen to vs from aboue to attaine to the high perfection of the law:<note place="margin">Our obedience to the lawe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfect, nor yet our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, by the grace of God, we bring to the law such obedience, as we may.

Forsomuch as man hath vtterly dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged what soeuer God hath cōmaunded, how thē can y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cōmaundements be said to be impossible to man, which man hath fulfilled?

For as we acknowledge God to be iust in geuing the lawe, to declare thereby what we should be: so double wise we haue to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and thanke his mercy, first for geuing such à person vnto vs which hath satisfied y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law for vs: and also in not condemning vs for our partes, not fulfilling it our selues: but hath set in

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Concil.

For when man in Paradise was in state of innocencie, he was not obediently content with that felicitie wherin he was, but disobediently would needes extend his hand to the tree of knowledge of good &amp; euill: and albeit almighty God gaue hym sufficient warning before what daunger would follow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gene.</hi> 3.</note> yet he of wilfull presumptiō would nedes taste of the fruite forbidden. Which being done, then began
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2699:40"/> hys eyes to be open: then did he see, then did he know, and then began he to couer. Now, if the law of nature did not first enter with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge into the world, let y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> aduersaries thē selues tell me when it began to enter. If it did: then let them aunswere how the law frist was geuē, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods owne free motion and mere doing, or els by mans owne seeking and procurement. To conclude therefore, if man procured the lawe vpon hys owne head, which when he had done, he was not able to performe, then let vs not say that God gaue à law to man, which man coulde not fulfill: but let vs say, that mans ōwne wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse procured à law to him self, which afterward was not in his possibilitie to accomplishe. But of this inough. The rest I referre to the exercised spirituall Christian to muse more vpon.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as touching their allegation of Christes wordes: <hi>Take my yoke vpon you, for my yoke is sweete, and my burden is light: &amp;c.</hi> by which wordes they argue the commaundementes of God to be easie &amp; possible to be kept: I aūswere,<note place="margin">What is ment by the wordes of Christ: <hi>My yoke is light, my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is easie.</hi>
               </note> that these wordes of Christ meane not the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but are to be vnderstand of the receauing of Christ to be our Messias &amp; Sauiour, and that we shoulde become subiectes vnder hys kingdome, that is, to beleue in him, and to be hys Disciples: who in so doing shall finde hys yoke and our subiection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hym, to be pleasaunt &amp; sweete. For there shall we haue remissiō of all our sinnes, shall ouercome the deuill and the world, shall be free from death, shall be eased from ceremonies, shall be raised in

For whatsoeuer was prefigured or prophecied in the Scriptures before of his suffering, was now accomplished.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2699:47"/> so did he. That his frends should all forsake him: so did his Disciples. That he should be falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused: so was he. That he should be scourged and wounded for our iniquities: it came to passe. The slaying of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Easter Lābe declared that he should die an innocent at Easter: and so did he. The rosting of the Lambe declared y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hote iudgement of God vpon him for our sinnes: he felt no lesse. <hi>Sampson</hi> was scorned &amp; derided of his enemies: but what followed? <hi>Sampson</hi> being thus derided, ouerthrew the house, and did more hurt to them, and profite to his people by his death, then by all his life before: euen so did Christ. In <hi>Esay</hi> it was prophecied of his beating about the face &amp; chekes: so it came to passe. In the Psalmes it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed of goring hys handes and his feete, of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all his bones, of nodding their heades, of their opprobrious mockes, of diuiding hys gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of geuing him bitter vineger. In <hi>Zachary</hi> it was prophecied, that the day also should be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vntill euening: and so it was. All these things being now complete, which belonged to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> paines of his bitter passion, and that Christ our heauenly Sauiour perceaued now nothing to lacke more to the fulfilling of our redemption, immediatly vpon the same, commended his spirite to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers handes with à mighty cry, and so letting downe his head, gaue vp the ghost.</p>
            <p>But before I come to this finall closing vp of his life, let vs first heare and see, how Christ thus hanging and silent vpon the Crosse, beginneth hys victory, to cast out the prince of thys worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:2699:48"/> and what he sayth vnto him, though not in open speach, yet in effect of spirite, and power of hys passion. For this we must vnderstand, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> drift and purpose of Christes death was not to fight with man,<note place="margin">Christ came not to wrastle with man, but against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for man.</note> nor to wrastle against flesh and bloud. No, no, rather he fought for man, and prayed for thē that crucified him, saying: <hi>Father forgeue them, they know not what they do.</hi>

            <p>And here now hauing taken down the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body of Iesus frō the Crosse, to occupy your eyes, and to delite your mindes, I entend, by the grace of Christ crucified,<note place="margin">A new Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe set vp at Paules Crosse.</note> to set vp here in Paules Crosse, or rather in Christes Crosse, an other Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, à new Crucifixe, à new Roode vnto you, à Crucifixe that may do all Christen hartes good to behold.<note place="margin">The strength of the Law.</note> This Crucifixe is he that crucified all mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and hath brought many à man to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, to the Crosse, to the gibbet, and at last cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Christ our Sauiour also. So seuere was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2699:58"/> he, that he spared none: so strong, being armed with Gods iustice &amp; iudgement, that none could escape him. And now shall ye see him hanged vp,<note place="margin">The triumph of Christ ouer the law.</note> and crucified him self: the meryest and most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest sight, that euer came to man. Lift vp your heades therefore (O ye faythfull of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord) with ioyfull thankes vnto God: and as ye lamented euē now in beholding the innocent sonne of God wrongfully crucified, and sore tormented vpō the Crosse: so now reioyce as much in beholding this new Crucifixe, which before was à crucifier and à iudge, but now both iudged and crucified him selfe, to all your comfortes. Ye muse peraduēture and maruell what great Crucifixe this should be: and no doubt à great Crucifixe it is, and therfore required à great crucifier, &amp; so he had: both great cōquerours, and both them selues crucified, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not of like greatnesse, nor of like cōdition:<note place="margin">The Sonne of God: The Law of God, both crucified.</note> the one our Sauiour, the other our condemner: the one for à few houres crucified, the other for euer: the one wrōgfully, the other iustly put to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> crosse: the one of hys owne mere will, the other of mere force &amp; by conquest.

By thys fall, the law of God in casting him down, was cast in his owne trippe and forgot him selfe. For where the law sayth: <hi>he that doth the commaundementes shall liue in them,</hi> Christ kept the law and yet contrary to the law, liued not in it.

            <p>And that is it, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> here speaketh and meaneth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.</note> saying: <hi>He hath dispatched the obligation or handwriting that was against vs in decrees, and hath cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified it fast to the crosse. &amp;c.</hi> Wherein the phrase of <hi>S.

If he had but said, that Christ had pluckt vs out from the daunger of the law: or that he had stayed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sentence of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against vs, or had repriued vs frō the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the law, it had bene much, &amp; à ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter (no doubt) of singular comfort vnto vs. For what more comfort can be to à giltie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, cast by the law, then to heare the peremptory sentence of iudgement against him, stayed, reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or turned away? And yet in thys comfort, some feare remaineth withall, so long as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2699:60"/> of the Iudge endureth, and as the lawe still standeth, whom he offended.</p>
            <p>But now marke (O ye faithfull of the Lorde, especially you, that labour &amp; be laden in cōscience) and expend well y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heauenly message of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Apostle, what he speaketh of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law, and how he speaketh.<note place="margin">Affixit illud cruci suae. &amp;c.</note> He saith not that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sentence of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is stayed, &amp; that we are pardoned, nor sayth that the action is fallen, and we repriued. No, no, he goeth further, &amp; telleth vs plainly, that the law which was against vs, our accuser &amp; condemner, is slaine, killed, crucified, &amp; nailed fast both hand and foote, &amp; so crucified, not as Christ was, to rise againe the third day, neither hath the lawe such power to rise againe as the sonne of God did, but remaineth slaine and abolished for euer, neuer to rise againe nor to haue any more power against them that be in Christ Iesu.<note place="margin">The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the law not stayed but killed to all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans.</note> Whereby the case of our saluation standeth firme &amp; substantiall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feare of iudgement and condemnation. For if there be no accusing nor condemning but by the law, then to kill the law, which killeth vs, what is it els, but to discharge vs from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for euer? He that deliuereth his frend for à time out of his enemies hand, doth him à plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: but he that killeth the enemy, and riddeth him quite out of the way, geueth perpetuall safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So remission of sinnes by Christ, if it were for sometimes, and not for all times, for some sinnes, and not for all sinnes, then the law had liued still.<note place="margin">The killing of the law impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our safetie to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> But now the killing and crucifying of the lawe importeth full remission to be absolute and our
<pb facs="tcp:2699:61"/> safetie to be perpetuall. Wherby cōmeth now the saying of the Apostle to be true:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note>
               <hi>That there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation now to thē that be in Christ Iesu, which walke not after the fleshe, but after the spirite. &amp;c.</hi> And why is there no more condemnation? For the law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slaine, which was the accuser, <hi>who shall now lay accusation against the elect? It is God that iustifieth, and who is he then, or where is he that shall condemne?</hi> Where is he? If ye will nedes know where he is, <hi>S. Paul</hi> will tell you. There he is (sayth he) vpon the tree, vpon the Crosse of Christ fast crucified. A dead man (sayth our prouerbe) can do no hurt. Euen so no trembling conscience needeth now to feare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> power of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law, that is in Christ. Neither is there to hym now any lawe to condemne hym, as the said Apostle most comfortably teacheth vs, saying:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note>
               <hi>Sinne shall not preuaile ouer you.</hi> And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note>
               <hi>which is the power of sinne,</hi> is now dead to vs. So that like as if à woman be discharged from her first husband being dead,<note place="margin">The law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the first husband, Christ to the second.</note> and hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed an other man, the first husbād hath no more power ouer her: euen so we now being espoused vnto Christ our second husband, are freed vtterly from our first husband the law, and as <hi>S.

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note>
               <hi>are no more vnder the law,</hi> that is, vnder the dominion &amp; malediction of <hi>the law, but vnder grace,</hi> that is, vnder perpetuall remission of sinnes, committed not onely before our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as well also after, and during all our life long:<note place="margin">Gods great grace ought to be no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to sinne.</note> Adding this lesson withall (as foloweth in the same place) not that sinners now should sinne the more therfore, because they are vnder grace:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2699:61"/> but that weake infirmitie might be relieued, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken consciences comforted, and repēting sinners holpen from desperation, to the prayse of Gods glory. For as God forgeueth not sinners because they should sinne: so neither doth infirmitie of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling diminishe the grace of Christ, where fayth with repentaunce worketh.</p>
            <p>These things standing so, seing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our first hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bād y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law is now deceassed (as <hi>S.

               <hi>that we may lawfully now mary an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband, euen him that is risen againe from the dead, to fructifie vnto God, through obedience of good life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much touching the triumph of this glorious prince. Wherein you haue heard, what mighty &amp; perilous enemies he hath subdued, and all by him selfe, and yet not for him selfe, but for vs. For somuch as the debt was not his but ours,
<pb facs="tcp:2699:62"/> which he for vs did acquite. For we had forfeited to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> deuill our soule, to death our bodies, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the law. He then taking our quarell in hand, trode vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Serpētes head, threw down the deuil, destroied death, captiued captiuitie, and crucified the law. So that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> labour was his: the victory is ours, he had the paines, we had y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, according as we read in <hi>S.

               <hi>and you haue entred into their labours. &amp;c.</hi> Also in the same place: <hi>One</hi> (sayth he) <hi>soweth the ground, and an other reapeth the fruite. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, what fruite it is that we doe reape by this blessed sowing of Christ (who not onely was the sower, but also the seede sowen) it is shewed now in the end of our text and message, in these wordes of the Apostle:
<q>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The text. </seg>
                  </label> That we might be made the righteousnesse of God by him.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In which fewe wordes is briefly compact all the felicitie that euer can come to mankinde. For as sinne was the spring originall of all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries &amp; mischiefes that euer happened to man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:<note place="margin">The fruite and effect of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes passion.</note> so now righteousnesse likewise is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> originall cause that bringeth life and all goodnesse to man. Here then is righteousnesse set against sinne: two contraryes fighting, one to counterpease with the other: both of equall force to contrary effectes.

               </gap> againe that righteousnesse which bringeth life and aeternall saluatiō, must likewise be perfect in man. Which because it can not be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2699:62"/> found in our own actions, it must be sought in the actions of an other, &amp; imputed to vs as our own, which may stand effectuall. And that is it, which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostle here sayth:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>That we might be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God by him. &amp;c.</hi> as much to say: that we might be accounted righteous before God, with that righteousnes, not which is in vs &amp; is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but which is in Christ &amp; by him is imputed to vs through fayth, which iustifieth vs before God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we must remember here to make à distinctiō of <hi>Iustitia,</hi> of righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Two sortes of righteousnesse in Scripture to be noted.</note> by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which after the doctrine of <hi>S.

            <p>Our aduersaries, which hold with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and persecute vs for holding with the Gospell, say that the meane cause,<note place="margin">The meane cause wherby the merites of Christes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be applied to vs.</note> or instrumental cause or condition whereby the passion of Christ is made auayleable and effectuous to vs, is not onely our fayth in Christ, but diuers and sundry other helpes they ioyne besides: as auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, contrition sufficient, &amp; satisfaction, propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatory sacrifice of the Masse, pardons and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of the Pope the storehouse of the Church;<note place="margin">Errour of the Papistes in applying the merites of Christes passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by wrong meanes.</note> merites and Inuocation of saintes, to beleue the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be subiect to the Bishop therof. And these they take as necessary matters to saluatiō, which vnlesse à mā do annexe withall as tyme and occasion serueth, the death of Christ can not be applied (say they) as meritorious alone to saluation. Other concurrentes also they adde besides these aboue named, which albeit they touch not so nere the necessitie of saluation, yet they helpe well forward, &amp; augment the working and merites of Christes passion, to our saluation. And these they count to be merites of supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Councells, workes of perfection, building of Monasteries, geuing to Churches, hearing of Masses, entring to Religiō, austeritie of life, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of vowes, wilfull pouerty, and such like.</p>

            <p>Onely the fayth which to iustification auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,<note place="margin">What fayth iustifieth.</note> is that fayth whose obiect is the body &amp; passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> crucified.<note place="margin">Christ crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, onely the obiect of faith.</note> Like as in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> act of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the eyes of the <hi>Israelites</hi> and the body of the brasen Serpēt went together: so in the act of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying these ij, fayth and Christ, haue à mutuall relation, and must alwayes concurre, faith as the action which apprehendeth: Christ as the obiect which is apprehended.

            <p>Furthermore, as thys Iustifying fayth goeth euer with his obiect,<note place="margin">Fayth in wordes onely professed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth men. Faith inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sturring by workes iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth before God.</note> so to the same faith also must be required, that it stand not onely in outward profession, in wordes, in toung &amp; talke, as swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming onely in the lippes, nor in outward formes, in shewes and gestures onely, which is but à dead and idle fayth, making an hypocrite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, rather then à iustified man before God: but must enter further into the inward hart: and as the sustenance of the soule, must inwardly be receaued &amp; digested. For as sustenance of bread and drinke,<note place="margin">Similitude betwene the bread and the body of Christ.</note> being holden onely in the hand, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon with the eye nourisheth not, except the same be inwardly receaued, and conueyed into the stomacke: and yet neither againe the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of euery thing susteineth mans body, except it be meate and drinke, which haue their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on properly to nourishe: in like sort is it with faith. For as beleuing of euery truth, or fayth of euery obiect saueth not, but that faith only which is in Christes bloud:<note place="margin">Faith the onely which recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the body of Christ.</note> so neither againe doth the same bloud of Christ profite vs, except by fayth it be inwardly receaued. And as the Sunne, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all light, shineth not but onely to such; which haue eyes to see, nor yet to thē vnlesse they open their eyes to receaue light: so the body of Christ Crucified being the materiall sustenaunce
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2699:68"/> onely of our soules, it followeth that the skine su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance must be receaued by fayth into our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hartes, or els it is not effectuall. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ tooke bread, and called it by the name of hys body, to be eaten and receaued.</p>
            <p>Vpon which premisses thus discussed, now I come to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> definition of Iustifying faith,<note place="margin">Iustifying fayth defined.</note> which by the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul</hi> is this: <q>An inward appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending in hart, of Christ Iesus y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sonne of God, beleuing by hys death freely to be purged frō all our sinnes, &amp; to be iustified by his resurrection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thys fayth,<note place="margin">Faith onely iustifieth, and the reason why.</note> because it is the onely condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> promise of God requireth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to our iustification, and none other: therfore we with the Scripture say, that fayth onely of all actions, qualities, giftes, motions, or sciences in man, doth onely iustifie: not excluding thereby good workes frō Christen life, but onely from the office of iustifying: not separating fayth from works, but distinguishing their endes:<note place="margin">Good workes the effectes of fayth: not causes of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> cōcluding thus, that good workes be effectes of Christen fayth, not causes of iustificatiō. But this doctrine as it hath many aduersaries, &amp; great obiections: so it requireth à more copious tractation. In the meane time briefly to shew how good workes be the effectes of fayth, ye shall heare what <hi>S. Paule</hi> sayth in the matter: whereby marke I pray you the genealogie of good workes. <hi>Fayth</hi> (sayth he) <hi>which worketh by loue. &amp;c. <hi>Galat. 5.</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.</note> Where ye see first how fayth gendreth loue:<note place="margin">The genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of good workes.</note> loue begetteth good works: Loue foloweth fayth, good works follow loue, faith goeth before as mother to them both.
<pb facs="tcp:2699:69"/> And this is the right and naturall genealogie of good workes. Loue in man commonly neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth vnlesse it be prouoked by some commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and how then shall à man hartily beginne to loue God, except he first see his loue and benefites in Christ his sonne toward him? Or how shall à man worke liuely, except first he loue hartily? And therfore in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrine of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which of late hath so darkned these mercies of God in Christ, I maruell how either à man could loue well, or liue well.</p>
            <p>But of this enough, and here an end: not for lacke of matter,<note place="margin">The perora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but for very werynes. I haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerspent the time, I see, &amp; my voyce likewise, and almost me selfe also.

Wherfore I shall desire you: looke for no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lēne peroratiō of me. Onely in stede of a repetitiō, I wil conclude w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> a litle short exhortatiō, as wery as I am: praying you, as I first began, according to the wordes of my message: <hi>Rogamus pro Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto,</hi> I pray you for Cristes loue, and not I alone, but all the ministers &amp; messengers of Christ in all Englād with me, do pray you with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> &amp; with all the Apostles of Christ, and not we onely, yea God him selfe by all his Apostles, ministers, and messengers, we all do pray and entreate you, not as messengers of men, nor of any Bishop, no nor of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> if he be a true Bishop, is but a messenger him selfe, and that onely in his owne Dioces where he is Bishop. In Christes name we pray you, that you,

Alack he is no God, nor yet good mā, his reconciliation can doe vs no good, and is not worth à rush. Our message is,<note place="margin">Gods frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship freely offred.</note> that ye will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōciled vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> liuing God. And as you haue long tasted of his wrath, so now begin to tast his frēd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. A better frend ye cā not haue. Yea, to say the truth, no other frend ye lacke but him. Whō if ye haue your frend, no enemy can do you hurt. If he be your enemy, no frend cā do you good.

Take therfore while it is offered. Refuse not,<note place="margin">Gods frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not to be refused.</note> lest ye be refused. Craue and haue. Come &amp; spare not. Be bolde and feare not. For what should let you to be bolde, hauing such à patrone to make your way for you? if Gods wrath do feare you, he
<pb facs="tcp:2699:70"/> hath killed it. If ye dread the law, he hath han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it. If your hart condemne you, he is greater then your hart. If ye be sicke, he came therfore, to play the Phisition. If ye be hūgry, he is the bread of life. If ye be poore, he was made poore for you, to make you rich. If Gods curse lye vpon you, he was made accursed for you. If ye be sinnefull, he was made sinne for you, that you might be made the righteousnesse of God by him. What can we haue more of him, or what can he do more for vs then this, which is all?

            <p>Let it not be seene nor sayd in <hi>London,</hi> that here is great talking of the Gospell, &amp; little wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the Gospell. And if your preachers doe rightly teach you that by fayth onely in Christ, you are iustified, now let not the Papistes then falsely outface you, that your preachers teach you no good workes: neither let them vpbrayde your Christian knowledge, for lacke of Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation: but rather by good liuing stoppe their mouthes, that either by your workes ye may winne them to glorifie your father which is in heauen, or at least they may haue no occasion to cauill, which would carpe your fayth.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2699:72"/> she is not alone. In her office alone, in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise not alone. The Queene, though in her state and office she be alone, yet she goeth not without her maides of honour after her.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Or that the promise of God (which is to saluation) standeth not free, without any condition of worke or workes to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that effect, saue onely fayth in that person:</p>

And if you will not let the word be iudge: yet let the world heare your reasons, let truth with iudgement be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let railing, trifling, and scoffing goe. Bloud and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no way to finde truth, but to blinde truth. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in matter of saluation are plaine and euident, teaching simply without trope or figure, and soone will try the cause.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> By the which Scriptures, if you shall finde the contrary to be true, that is, that the passion of Christ crucified is the onely materiall and efficient cause immediate which worketh our saluation, which appeaseth Gods wrath, and pacifieth all thinges in heauen and in earth, taketh away the sinnes of the world, and disanulleth the damnation and malediction of the law for euer, from all them that be in Christ Iesu:</p>
